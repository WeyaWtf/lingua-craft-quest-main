## 📚 PART 1: Related Vocabulary (Relative Clauses)

### What are Relative Clauses?

**Definition**: Relative clauses are phrases that modify (describe) nouns, similar to "who," "which," or "that" in English.

**Key Rule**: In Japanese, the relative clause comes BEFORE the noun it modifies, and the verb must be in PLAIN FORM (not ます form).

### Structure: [Relative Clause] + Noun

```
[Plain Form Verb] + Noun
母が作った + ご飯 = the rice that mother made
私が読む + 本 = the book that I read
```

### Plain Form Conjugation

| Verb Type | ます Form | Plain Form (Present) | Plain Form (Past) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Group 1 | 書きます (kakimasu) | 書く (kaku) | 書いた (kaita) |
| Group 1 | 作ります (tsukurimasu) | 作る (tsukuru) | 作った (tsukutta) |
| Group 1 | 買います (kaimasu) | 買う (kau) | 買った (katta) |
| Group 2 | 食べます (tabemasu) | 食べる (taberu) | 食べた (tabeta) |
| Group 2 | 見ます (mimasu) | 見る (miru) | 見た (mita) |
| Group 3 | します (shimasu) | する (suru) | した (shita) |
| Group 3 | 来ます (kimasu) | 来る (kuru) | 来た (kita) |

### Important Verbs for Level 11

| Kanji/Kana | Rōmaji | English | Plain Form | Past Plain |
|------------|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| 作る | tsukuru | make, prepare | 作る (tsukuru) | 作った (tsukutta) |
| 買う | kau | buy | 買う (kau) | 買った (katta) |
| あげる | ageru | give | あげる (ageru) | あげた (ageta) |
| もらう | morau | receive | もらう (morau) | もらった (moratta) |
| 書く | kaku | write | 書く (kaku) | 書いた (kaita) |
| 読む | yomu | read | 読む (yomu) | 読んだ (yonda) |
| 撮る | toru | take (photo) | 撮る (toru) | 撮った (totta) |
| 借りる | kariru | borrow | 借りる (kariru) | 借りた (karita) |

### Particle Changes in Relative Clauses

**CRITICAL RULE**: When the subject inside a relative clause is different from the main sentence subject, use が (not は).

❌ 母**は**作ったご飯 (WRONG)
✅ 母**が**作ったご飯 (CORRECT - the rice that mother made)

### Examples with Structure Breakdown

| Japanese | Structure | English |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 母が作った熱いご飯 | [母が作った] + [熱い] + ご飯 | the hot rice that mother made |
| 私が読む本 | [私が読む] + 本 | the book that I read |
| 友達がくれた辞書 | [友達がくれた] + 辞書 | the dictionary that my friend gave me |
| 昨日買った眼鏡 | [昨日買った] + 眼鏡 | the glasses I bought yesterday |
| 先生が教える日本語 | [先生が教える] + 日本語 | the Japanese that the teacher teaches |

### Detailed Examples with Tenses

| Tense | Japanese | Rōmaji | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Present** | 母が作るご飯 | haha ga tsukuru gohan | the rice that mother makes (regularly) |
| **Past** | 母が作ったご飯 | haha ga tsukutta gohan | the rice that mother made |
| **Negative** | 母が作らないご飯 | haha ga tsukuranai gohan | the rice that mother doesn't make |
| **Past Neg** | 母が作らなかったご飯 | haha ga tsukuranakatta gohan | the rice that mother didn't make |

### Relative Clauses with Adjectives

You can combine adjectives with relative clauses:

```
[Adjective] + [Relative Clause] + Noun
大きくて + [母が作った] + ご飯 = the big rice that mother made
```

### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Subject + が + Verb (plain) + Noun**
- 友達が書いた手紙 = the letter that my friend wrote

**Pattern 2: Time + Verb (plain) + Noun**
- 昨日買った本 = the book I bought yesterday

**Pattern 3: Place + で + Verb (plain) + Noun**
- 図書館で読んだ本 = the book I read at the library

**Pattern 4: あげる/もらう/くれる (giving/receiving)**
- 友達にあげた写真 = the photo I gave to my friend
- 友達にもらった辞書 = the dictionary I received from my friend
- 母がくれた眼鏡 = the glasses my mother gave me

### Key Differences from English

| English | Japanese Structure | Example |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| The book **that** I read | [私が読む] 本 | 私が読む本 |
| The rice **that** mother made | [母が作った] ご飯 | 母が作ったご飯 |
| The person **who** came | [来た] 人 | 来た人 |

**Note**: There is NO word for "that/which/who" in Japanese - the plain form verb directly modifies the noun!

## 🎓 Pedagogical Notes for Level 11

**Key Teaching Points:**

1. **Plain Form Mastery**: Students MUST learn plain form conjugation:
   ```
   ます形 → Plain Form
   食べます → 食べる (present)
   食べます → 食べた (past)
   作ります → 作る (present)
   作ります → 作った (past)
   ```

2. **Particle Switch - が vs は**: This is CRITICAL in relative clauses:
   - ❌ 母**は**作ったご飯 (WRONG)
   - ✅ 母**が**作ったご飯 (CORRECT)
   - The subject INSIDE a relative clause uses が, not は

3. **No Relative Pronoun**: Unlike English, Japanese has NO word for "that/which/who":
   - English: The book **that** I read
   - Japanese: 私が読む本 (literally: "I-subject-read book")

4. **Word Order**: The relative clause comes BEFORE the noun:
   ```
   [Relative Clause] + Noun
   [母が作った] + ご飯
   [mother-subject-made] + rice
   ```

5. **Tense in Relative Clauses**: The tense of the relative clause verb can be different from the main verb:
   - 母が作った**ご飯を食べます** = I eat the rice that mother **made** (past relative, present main)
   - 母が作る**ご飯を食べました** = I ate the rice that mother **makes** (present relative, past main)

6. **Building Complexity**: Level 11 allows much more descriptive language:
   - Without relative clauses: ご飯は美味しいです (The rice is delicious)
   - With relative clauses: 母が今朝作ったご飯は美味しいです (The rice that mother made this morning is delicious)

**Common Student Errors:**

- ❌ 母が作りますご飯 (using ます form in relative clause)
- ✅ 母が作るご飯 (CORRECT - plain form)

- ❌ 私は読む本 (using は in relative clause)
- ✅ 私が読む本 (CORRECT - using が)

- ❌ 本私が読む (wrong word order)
- ✅ 私が読む本 (CORRECT - relative clause before noun)

- ❌ 友達にあげました本 (ました form in relative clause)
- ✅ 友達にあげた本 (CORRECT - plain past た)

**Progressive Learning Path:**
- Level 1-10: ます form only, simple sentences
- Level 11: Introduction to plain form through relative clauses
- Level 12+: More plain form usage in other grammatical structures

**Reading Support:**
- All kanji have furigana (hiragana reading above)
- Rōmaji provided for all sentences
- Focus on recognizing [relative clause] + noun patterns in context
- Practice identifying where the relative clause begins and ends
