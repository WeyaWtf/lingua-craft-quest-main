## 🎯 Pedagogical Notes

**Key Points for Teacher/Learner:**

1. **と marks WHO you're with**: 友達**と** = **with** friends
2. **と connects nouns**: りんご**と**バナナ = apples **and** bananas  
3. **Question word 誰と**: "With whom?" = 誰**と**行きますか
4. **Multiple と allowed**: 友達**と**兄**と** = with friends **and** older brother
5. **Particle order**: と comes AFTER the person: 母**と** (not と母)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ Using と before the person: **と**友達 ✗ → 友達**と** ✓
- ❌ Confusing と with で: Place で (location) vs Person と (companion)
- ❌ Using と for places: 学校**と**行く ✗ → 学校**に**行く ✓
- ❌ Forgetting other particles: Just 友達と食べる ✗ → 友達**と**レストラン**で**食べる ✓

**Pro Tips:**
- ✅ Think "to-gether" → と for together!
- ✅ と always marks PEOPLE/ANIMALS you're with, not places
- ✅ You can stack と: A と B と C = with A, B, and C
- ✅ Common pattern: [Person]と[Place]で[Activity] = do [Activity] at [Place] with [Person]
- ✅ Family members are common with と: 母と, 父と, 兄と, 姉と

**Memory Aids:**
- **と (to)**: "**To**gether with" - doing things together
- **誰と (dare to)**: "**Dare** to go with whom?" 
- **Friend + と**: Always think "**with** friend" not "**and** friend" (unless listing)
- **Multiple と**: Like English "with A, with B, with C"
